## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for detecting financial fraud in payment services using Apache Spark. Financial fraud is a significant issue in the banking and financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses and damages to both businesses and customers. Detecting fraudulent activities promptly is crucial for minimizing these losses and maintaining trust in financial systems.


## Features
- Data Preprocessing: The project involves preprocessing large volumes of transaction data to extract relevant features and prepare the data for model training.
- Model Development: Various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, are implemented using Spark's MLlib library to build predictive models for fraud detection.
- Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess their performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Requirements
- Apache Spark: The project requires Apache Spark for distributed data processing and machine learning.
- Python: Programming language for implementing Spark jobs and data analysis.
  
## Usage
- Training: Train the machine learning models using Spark's MLlib library with the preprocessed data with Decision Tree and Logistic Regression Algorithm
- EDA: visualize data with pie chart, bar chart, KDE by Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas

## Data:
- The dataset can access easily in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) with [Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/truongduynguyen/big-data)
